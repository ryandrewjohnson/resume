    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>I am a full-stack developer with 10+ years experience specializing in agile web application development and consulting. Although I work with across multiple technologies my specialty is in JavaScript with an emphasis on developing in React.js/AngularJS.</p>
    <p>I'm a coder at heart, and I count myself lucky to enjoy the craft I work in. For that reason you can usually find me contributing to Open Source projects, answering questions on Stack Overflow, publishing articles on Medium, or just doing my damndest to keep up with JavaScript frameworks.</p>
